                                    <p>Pedram is a Junior at Mountain View High School, and he has a passion for biology. He specifically enjoys exploring the vast disciplines of biology, such as neuroscience and biomedical engineering. He started STEM Research Pioneers in the end of his Sophomore year because he felt that research opportunities were extremely important and supported by high schoolers, yet school itself failed to provide any adequate opportunities for aspiring researchers like himself. With SRP, he hopes to spread the vast field of technical research to his peers he shares passions with, as well as develop his own background in technical research.</p>

                                    <p>Dylan is a Junior at Mountain View High School with a passion for computer science. More specifically, he is invested in implementing this interest to the related fields of data science and and machine learning which have become increasingly influential in fields ranging from medicine to industry is that better. He originally joined STEM Research Pioneers as the Vice President as a result of the lack of research opportunities presented to students at MVHS. With SRP, he strives to share the field of STEM-focused research with like-minded peers as well as further develop his own experience with technical research.
